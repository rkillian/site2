Polaroids is a free Wordpress theme ideal for both personal blogs and showcasing your portfolio/work.  Minimalist, clean, light and fast to load.

The thumbnail image shown for each post is the featured image (set this when editing the post) and if that doesn't exist, then it shows the post's main image instead.  The thumbnail is 185px (width) x 170px (height).

All of my themes are free for both personal and commercial use. I don't want any payment whatsoever - however if you feel like returning the favour, then please consider making a donation to one of the charities below:

http://www.amnesty.org/en/donate - Amnesty International.

http://www.oxfam.org.uk/donate - Oxfam.

Enjoy :)
